# NLW-Copa
Application developed at the Rocketseat Next Level Week Copa event. The application consists of a platform in which users can create pools to bet in
the games of the World Cup, creating a pool can be done anonymously through the web version but to participate in it you have to use the mobile version and be
logged in. The sign up and login system is made entirely by associating the account of the app with an google account. The only information that is taken is the
name and the user's profile picture.
